# Customer-Churn-Prediction-and-Sales
Customer Churn Prediction and Sales project created using Python Jupyter Notebook and PowerBI Dashboard.

## Project Overview 
The Customer Churn Prediction and Sales Dashboard project leverages Data Analytics and Machine Learning to analyse customer behaviour, predict churn probability, and visualise sales trends. This system is essential for businesses, e-commerce platforms, and service providers to enhance customer retention and optimise sales strategies.

## About the Dataset
A provider is facing a lot of competition in the current market, and it has become a challenge to retain the existing customers in the current situation. Hence, the company wants to develop a model  through which they can do churn prediction of the accounts and provide segmented offers to the  potential churners. In this company, account churn is a major thing because 1 account can have  multiple customers. Hence, by losing one account, the company might be losing more than one customer.
